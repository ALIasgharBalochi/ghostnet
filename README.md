# 👻 Ghost Net

**Ghost Net** is a real-time private messaging platform built with **Django**, **Django Channels**, **WebSocket**, and **JWT Authentication**. This project is currently under active development and aims to be a fast, secure, and scalable communication system for users who value privacy and performance.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Secure private chat between users
- 💬 Real-time messaging with WebSockets
- 🧪 JWT-based authentication (no session handling)
- 📁 RESTful APIs built with Django REST Framework
- 🏗 Modular, scalable backend architecture
- 🛡 Custom user model for flexibility

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Backend: Django + Django Channels
- Real-Time: WebSocket, Redis
- Auth: JWT (djangorestframework-simplejwt)
- Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite (dev)
- Frontend: Not implemented yet (API ready)
- Deployment: Docker (WIP)

## 📡 Realtime Chat with WebSocket

Using Django Channels and Redis, each user can establish a WebSocket connection to communicate in real-time. The system uses `AsyncWebsocketConsumer` to handle message broadcasting and saving them to the database.

## 🔐 JWT Authentication

Authentication is handled using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** which ensures stateless, scalable authentication. We're using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`.

## 👷 Work in Progress

Ghost Net is currently in the **development phase**. We're actively building features like:

- User profile customization
- Read receipts
- Typing indicators
- File sharing in chat
